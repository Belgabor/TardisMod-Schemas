Schemas for the Minecraft mod TardisMod ([Curse](http://www.curse.com/mc-mods/minecraft/230170-tardis-mod)/[MCF](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2420176-tardis-mod-updated-to-v0-99-on-13-08-2015))


## Rooms
Various rooms for specific uses

### Big Farm Fixed

### LP Relay
Intended as a central relay for a Logistics Pipes setup inside the TARDIS. Central indented spot for the power junction, lots of roundels to connect inventory connector pipes to.


## Utility
Various corridors and elevators for tighter setups.
Corridors are desginated by internal length (blocks between the doors).
Some have a "niche" variant, those have one or two wall niches prepared to house an ME terminal or LP request table flush with the wall providing enough space for the necessary infrastructure.
Elevator nomeclatur is as follows:
a b c
a) Vertical size in small height steps (aka like the vanilla up/down corridors)
b) Number of intermediate levels
c) Level number, 1 being the bottom one, the elevator connects on
Example: 2 1 1 means the elevator is two "stories" big, has three stops (bottom, middle, top) and connects on the bottommost level. 2 0 1 whould basically match the vanilla "Up Further" corridor.
